# redux, async, in react environment

this exercise I create redux slices, store with toolkit in a react environment.  has async fetch using axios.  create state with
loading, data, and error keys. fetch data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/. there we have users, albums, todos, companies data to 
fetch and manipulate.  this was built with help from codevolution redux series.  it is a simple project, but i expanded it to include all
available data and some basic manipulation to customize what would be displayed on the webpage.  for me, several challenges encountered helped
better understand the react redux app.
